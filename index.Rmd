I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.rowan.edu/programs/electricalcomputer/) at [Rowan University](http://www.rowan.edu/), where I perform research in data mining and applied machine learning.

My current research interests are in machine. More specifically: 

- Adversarial Machine Learning: Security, Defenses and Attacks
- Learning from Large Volume Data Streams with Changing Dynamics 
- Applications of Machine Learning: Cybersecurity, Life Science, and Medicine
