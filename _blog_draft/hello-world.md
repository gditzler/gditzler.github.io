This is a sample blog post to verify that the blog section is working correctly. You can replace this with your own content.

## Getting Started

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator written in Rust. Here are a few things you might want to do next:

- Replace the placeholder headshot in `static/images/headshot.jpg`
- Update the social links in `zola.toml`
- Edit `content/about.md` with your actual bio and work history
- Add your real publications to `content/publications.md`

## Code Example

Here is an example code block to verify syntax highlighting:

```python
import numpy as np

def hello_world():
    """A simple function to demonstrate syntax highlighting."""
    data = np.random.randn(100, 10)
    mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
    print(f"Mean shape: {mean.shape}")
    return mean

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = hello_world()
```

The syntax highlighting theme should switch between dark and light when you toggle the theme.
