Funding is available for highly qualified students (preferably to Ph.D. students that have already completed their MSc thesis and published in reputable journals and conferences). Preference will be given to exceptional students seeking to pursue a Ph.D. with interests in machine learning.\nIf you are currently a student at Rowan University, contact Gregory Ditzler at ditzler (at) rowan.edu with your resume and research interests. Please include any publications if you have them. If you are not at Rowan University, you should apply for graduate studies.\nYou should read “How to Be a Successful PhD Student” by Hanna Wallach and Mark Dredze. It is well-written guide that provides to tips on being successful in graduate school."

In this work, you will explore theoretical and empirical avenues to understand the influence and an adversary in a lifelong machine learning scenario. You will be investigating new and novel methods to attack and defend machine learning models. Other areas of machine learning will be tightly integrated into this project, including feature selection, and algorithmic fairness.\nSupport: Graduate assistant appointments will be offered to PhD students, providing stipend and tuition support. Exceptionally, graduate assistantships could also be offered to MSc students, depending on availability and qualifications.\nDesired Qualities for a Candidate\nMust have\n\nExperience with Python and writing reusable code / packages / modules.\nKnowledgeable about machine learning and data science techniques.\nSkilled communicator and able to discuss methods and findings with other researchers outside of machine learning and data science.\nExtremely organized and a record of clear documentation.\nIndependent learner and can pick up new concepts related to coding and mathematics.\n\nGood to have\n\nExperience with the high-performance computing resources at Rowan University or Microsoft Azure / AWS / Google Cloud will be useful.\nExperience in Linux and Bash. Any flavor of Linux will do!\nOther: Git, LaTeX, SQL, Visual Studio Code.\n\nPlease send an email to the professor with your resume, GPA, and degree. You are encouraged to contact the me if you are interested in participating in the research. Please put “Research: Last Name: Machine Learning Research,” write a brief paragraph on why you’re a great fit for this research and attach a copy of your resume.
